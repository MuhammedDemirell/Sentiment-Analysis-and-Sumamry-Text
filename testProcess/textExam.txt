On this day, people listen to and play music in their local area. You can listen to music in the street, outside bars and cafés, in parks and other public spaces. You don't have to pay for these concerts – the musicians play for free. World Music Day encourages all amateur and professional musicians, young and old, to perform and it aims to make all genres of music available to the public.
